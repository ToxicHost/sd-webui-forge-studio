# Studio Standalone — Git tester candidate

Distribution identifier: 0.0.0-internal-alpha. Run `git rev-parse HEAD` for the
exact installed revision. This is an alpha candidate for Windows/NVIDIA testing.

## Git delivery cleanup — 2026-09-15

The tester branch now contains runtime source, installation helpers, user guides
and licenses. Project plans, agent instructions, Docker/deployment files, tests,
legacy WebUI entry points and release-build tools are removed from this branch.
The retained engine, Studio frontend, launchers, installers and requirements are
unchanged. Existing installations can receive this cleanup with `git pull --ff-only`.

Start-Studio.bat creates or repairs the local Python environment, verifies the
six auxiliary models, and opens Studio. Python 3.11–3.13 is accepted; use 3.13 for
this candidate. Existing settings are preserved. The launcher creates empty
models/Stable-diffusion, models/VAE and models/text_encoder folders; users supply
their own generation models and choose model directories in Settings.

The five Auto Detail detectors and Remacri are downloaded from studio-assets-v1
only when missing, with pinned size/hash verification. This cleanup does not
change that release or any generation, sampling or painting behavior.

See [installation](GIT_INSTALL.md), [tester notes](FRIENDS_ALPHA_TESTER_GUIDE.md)
and [feature status](TESTER_FEATURE_STATUS.md). ControlNet, Live generation,
Workshop and regional inference are unavailable in this Standalone candidate.
Updates are manual. Real generation, interactive browser/tablet acceptance and
cross-platform certification remain separate from these installation checks.
